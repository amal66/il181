# Kubernetes Tutorial
Distributed Systems Assignment

This repository contains the files needed to compelete the Kubernetes tutorial at https://medium.com/p/fc92df972148. 

The files contained are as follows: 
1. hello-svc.yaml is a configuration that deploys the hello world service, which fundamentally returns the IP address a request was sent from
2. hello_deployment.yaml is a configuration that creates a Kubernetes deployment with pods landing on different hosts, to illustrate Experiment 2
3. example_deployment.yaml is a configuration where a sample app, httpbin, gets deployed.
